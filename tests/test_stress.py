Stress Tests

Stress tests push the system to its limits to find breaking points and performance issues.
These tests help identify bottlenecks, memory leaks, and concurrent access problems.

Run only stress tests with:
    pytest tests/test_stress.py -v
    pytest -m stress

Run stress tests (these take longer):
    pytest -m stress --tb=short

Skip stress tests during development:
    pytest -m "not stress"
    
Skip slow tests:
    pytest -m "not slow"

Key concepts:
    - Performance and load testing
    - Concurrent request handling
    - Resource utilization limits
    - Rate limiting verification
    - Breaking point identification
